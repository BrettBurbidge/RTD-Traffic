Using Traffic
-------------

Traffic
^^^^^^^
The traffic system runs commands to the telephone switch querying for specific traffic reports.  These reports are saved and reported on through the UTA interface. The traffic reports currently supported are listed below. Each of the following traffic reports can be viewed as a line or bar chart, exported to pdf, averaged by month, day or hour and time span.

Call Summary
^^^^^^^^^^^^
The Call Summary Measurements report provides an hourly summary of the traffic data for the last 24 hours. The system counts all call completions, except those generated by maintenance. For example, a Facility Test Call is not counted as a call completion. The system counts calls on initial completion and it does not count conference calls and transfer calls.  This report is queried every 24 hours.

Trunk Reports
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The following reports are displayed and queried based on the Trunk Group Summary report results.  The Trunk Group Summary report gives traffic measurements for all trunk groups except for personal central office line groups. This report determines the trunk group total usage (in CCS), the total number of calls, trunk blockage, and other measurement data. This report is queried every hour.
