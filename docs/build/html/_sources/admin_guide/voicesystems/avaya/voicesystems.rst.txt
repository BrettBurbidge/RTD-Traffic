Voice Systems
=============

By `Brett Burbidge`_

Introduction
------------
Voice Systems refer to the onsite Telephone Switch.  Voice Systems in |product| are where we configure Traffic data collection. 

As of |version| there are 2 supported Voice Systems for the collection and reporting of Traffic data, the Avaya CM and the Cisco CUCM. 

They both work a little different when collecting traffic information. 

Avaya CM
^^^^^^^^

|product| has worked with CM4 all the way through the CM8 to collect traffic information. When configuring a CM system select the **AvayaCM** as the Voice System Type.

This will provide you with different traffic collection options.
The Avaya CM Switch generates Traffic reports.  These traffic reports are collected and parsed by |product|. The parsed and aggregated versions of these reports is what users will report on.  

|product| collects these reports via SSH.  The |product| Service that runs in the background will issue commands to the CM over SSH or Telnet and the CM responds to these commands with traffic reports. 

.. note:: There are two ways to collect the Traffic reports from the CM.  1: Directly from the switch, 2: go through a Teleboss.

Depending on how the network is setup you may be able to go directly from the |product| Service to the CM.  In other cases this is prevented by Onsite firewalls. 

To go directly from the |product| Service to the CM simply leave the **Teleboss Host Name or IP** empty.  Like below:

If you are pulling the reports through the Teleboss you will need BOTH Switch and Teleboss information.  

The Teleboss acts as a "proxy". The |product| Service will issue a command "through" the proxy thus both the Teleoboss and Switch information is required.
