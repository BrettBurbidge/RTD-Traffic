Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^
Voice Systems refer to the onsite Telephone Switch.  Voice Systems in |product| are where we configure Traffic data collection. 

As of |version| there are 2 supported Voice Systems for the collection and reporting of Traffic data, the Avaya CM and the Cisco CUCM. 

They both work a little different when collecting traffic information.  See the detailed descriptions of each system in their relative link.
