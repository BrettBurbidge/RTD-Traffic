Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^
This document is a brief introduction to the Unique Communications Traffic & Alarms (UTA) system.  It is intended for internal employees, customers and anyone with general questions about the UTA system.  This document is an overview of the functionality of both the traffic and alarm systems. 

Functionality
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
UTA is split up into two primary systems traffic and alarms.  

The traffic portion queries the telephone switch for traffic reports, stores that information and builds easy to read reports based on that data.  

The alarm system listens for specific messages from pre-configured network elements and notifies technical personnel of element status.
